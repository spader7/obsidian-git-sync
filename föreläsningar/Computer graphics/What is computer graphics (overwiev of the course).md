### About the Course
- Theory:
	- Terminology
	- concepts
	- technologies
- Implementation:
	- Using a game Engine
- Discussion
	- Communication
	- problem solving

### Goals & Examination
1,5 credits = 40h work (1 week at 100% or 2 weeks at 50%)
- Identiry and describe central terminology in computer graphics
	- Home exam 3 credits
- Implement core funcionality to control the rendering in a game engine
	- 2 Assignments 3 credits
- identify, formulate and discuss relevant issues in computer graphics
	- Seminar 1.5 credits

### grading
- 2 assignments = fail or pass
- written exam = A - F
- course = A - F

### Assignments
- 2 projects in Unity ( 2 weeks each(roughly))
	- procedual Geometry
		- work in pairs: (picking your own pairs)
	- TBA (controland optimize rendering)
	- In the Course, we will use the Unity Game Engine. it is not  a course about Unity, all the techniqes and terminilogy can be used in any game engine.
- Scheduled Supervisions
	- two groups, A & B
	- Individual work with possibility to ask for help
	- Even if you dont need help: check in with th tachers during the rocess

- Weekly overwiev
	- 5 weeksfull time (10 weeks half time, 7.5 credits)
	- scheduled eery other week
	- time split between computer graphics and game analysis
	- plan your studies based on the two courses
### Weeks plan
- week 4 (first week)
	- 4 lectures (teory and terminology used thourgout the course)
	- self studies: chapter 1-4 in the course book (the crate)
	- optional: work on the practise assignment
	- start working on the geometry Assignment
	- week 6
		- 1 lecture (rasterization, shading models, uv-maps) (maybe 2 lectures)
		- first assignemnt deadline in unity
			- procedurally generated geometry
			- ...
	- week 8
		- 3 lectures (anti-aliasing, blending , light, transparency, shadows)
		- readchapter 5-7 in the course bool
		- pick a subject for the seminat from chapter 13-15
	- week 10
		- 1 lecture (performance, optimization, benhmaring)
		- second assignment deadline in unity
			- physical based rendering
		- Hand in seminar abstract (march 7th)
	- week 12
		- Home xam (5 days)
			- questions released on monday march 17th
			- hand in friday march 21st
